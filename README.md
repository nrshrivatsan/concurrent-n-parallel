concurrent-n-parallel
=====================

###Introduction

####Context

In the era of Internet, businesses which rely on software would love the following:

- Scale quick
- Reduce cost of Infrastructure
- Maintainable code

####Why Concurrent n Parallel

Languages are in plenty. Choosing one to do the above is a challenge.

There is code in here which expresses the concurrency and parallelism constructs of various languages.

There is also some analysis done on the code and comparisons are made to find which is better


####Benchmarking
